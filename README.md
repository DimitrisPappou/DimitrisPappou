### Projects
1. **Crosshair Generator**: A tool developed using ![HTML5](https://img.shields.io/badge/-HTML5-E34F26?style=flat&logo=html5) ![CSS3](https://img.shields.io/badge/-CSS3-1572B6?style=flat&logo=css3) ![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/-JavaScript-F7DF1E?style=flat&logo=javascript) ![Lua](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Lua-2C2D72?style=flat&logo=lua)

> It allows the client to modify his crosshair when he plays in a FiveM server, also saving it for the next session. This does not have anything to do with server side so this isn't heavy for the server as much as it isn't for the client since it is optimized.


2. **NPC Fighting Game**: An engaging game created with ![HTML5](https://img.shields.io/badge/-HTML5-E34F26?style=flat&logo=html5) ![CSS3](https://img.shields.io/badge/-CSS3-1572B6?style=flat&logo=css3) ![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/-JavaScript-F7DF1E?style=flat&logo=javascript) ![Lua](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Lua-2C2D72?style=flat&logo=lua)

> This is a game, where an npc spawns in a random location, allowing players to join the event and fight NPCs in random places inside a specified area. Also players are fighting each other in order to get the winning price.
